# Run like this:
#	perl -I../lib ./simple2zoom -c ../etc/test.xml @:9998
#
# Dynamically configurable using virtual database-name like:
#	cfg:key1=val1&key2=val2...
# For example:
#	cfg:preferredRecordSyntax=xml&address=localhost:8018//IR-Explain---1
# But PLEASE BE AWARE that, like Unix filenames with spaces in,
# complex "database names" like these often get parsed when you don't
# want them to.  Neither yaz-client nor zoomsh handles Z-target
# strings with database-names like these "correctly" (i.e. in the way
# we want them to).

# To run the server from its source, use:
#	cd /usr/local/src/cvs/simple2zoom/bin && perl -I../lib ./simple2zoom -c ../etc/test.xml -- -S -f ../etc/yazgfs.xml
# For a simple regression-test, use:
#	cd /usr/local/src/cvs/simple2zoom/bin && perl -I../lib ./simple2zoom -c ../etc/test.xml -- -1 -f ../etc/yazgfs.xml & (sleep 1; ( echo "find mineral"; echo "format sutrs"; echo "show 1") | yaz-client localhost:9998/gils )

=head1 NAME

simple2zoom - generic Swiss Army Server for proxying between IR standards

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<simple2zoom>
[
C<-c>
I<configFile>
]
[
C<-->
I<YAZ-options>
]
[
I<listener-address>
...
]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<simple2zoom> provides a generic gateway between the Z39.50 and
SRU/SRW Information Retrieval protocols.  Because it relies on the
C<Net::Z3950::SimpleServer> and C<ZOOM> modules for the server and
client funcationality respectively, because both of these modules are
based on the YAZ toolkit, and because YAZ transparently handles all
three standard IR protocols (ANDI/NISO Z39.50, SRU and SRW), it can
function as a gateway from any and to any of these protocols.
However, its principle purpose is as a Z39.50 server that proxies
requests through to a backend by acting as an SRU client.

The following command-line options govern how the gateway functions:

=over 4

=item -c configFile

Specifies that the named I<configFile> should be used to configure the
functionality of the gateway: if this option is not specified, then
the file C<client.xml> is used.  The format of the configuration file
is described separately in C<Net::Z3950::Simple2ZOOM::Config>, and a
sample configuration file, C<test.xml>, is supplied in the C<etc>
directory of the distribution.

=item --

Indicates the end of C<simple2zoom>-specific options.  This is
required if YAZ options are to be specified, so that C<simple2zoom>
doesn't try to interpret them itself.

=item I<YAZ-options>

Command-line arguments subsequent to the C<--> option are interpreted
by the YAZ backend server as described at
http://www.indexdata.dk/yaz/doc/server.invocation.tkl

These options provide the means to control many aspects of the
gateway's functioning: for example, whether the server forks a new
process for each client or runs a single process using C<select()>;
how (if at all) to interpret incoming SRU requests; whether and how to
log protocol packets for debugging.

=item I<listener-address>

One or more YAZ-style listener addresses may be specified, and the
server will accept connections on those addresses: for example,
C<@:9998>, C<unix:/tmp/somesocket> or C<ssl:myhost.com:210>.  If
no explicit listener addresses are provided, the server listens on
port 9999.
